Role: Act as a Senior Certification Specialist and Web Developer.

Task: Create a single, self-contained HTML file for a Life in UK practice exam.

Content Requirements:

I am assuming that 40 question are asked in the actual exam of ITIL Version 4, if there is a different number then based on that change the number of question answer below. 

Generate 5 varied sets of each, 40 high-probability multiple-choice questions covering all official exam domains. 

Each question must have 4 options (A, B, C, D).

Provide the Correct Answer and a concise explanation for every question.

Include a "Last-Minute Cram/Refresher" section at the top with key definitions, acronyms, and critical numbers to memorize.

Formatting & Technical Requirements (Strict):

One Single Line: Format the question and the 4 options on a single line to ensure high density and scannability.

Next Line Answer: Place the correct answer and explanation on the immediate next line.

Minimalist Style: Use a "brute-force" monospace style (font-family: monospace) with basic CSS (13px font size) so I can scan the entire document quickly.

No Hidden Logic: Do not use collapsible tags; display all text clearly so I can scroll and read at high speed.

Structure: Group the questions by their official Exam Domains (e.g., Service Value Chain, 7 Guiding Principles, etc.).

Self-Contained: All CSS and HTML must be in one block.

Tone: Professional, technical, and optimized for rapid retention.
